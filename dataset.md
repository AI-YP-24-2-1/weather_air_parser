* date - Date 2020.01.01 - 2024.10.25
* year - Year
* month - Month
* day - Day
* hour - Hour
* region - Region name
* city_name - City name
* city_id - Unique ID of city
* lat - Latitude
* lon - Longitude

* temperature_2m - Air temperature at 2 meters above ground (Celcius)
* relative_humidity_2m - Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground (%)
* rain - Only liquid precipitation of the preceding hour including local showers and rain from large scale systems (mm)
* snowfall - Snowfall amount of the preceding hour in centimeters (mm)
* snow_depth - Snow depth on the ground (m)
* surface_pressure - Atmospheric air pressure reduced to mean sea level (msl) or pressure at surface. Typically pressure on mean sea level is used in meteorology. Surface pressure gets lower with increasing elevation (hPa)
* cloud_cover - Total cloud cover as an area fraction
* wind_speed_10m - Wind speed at 10 meters above ground. Wind speed on 10 meters is the standard level (m/s)

* pm10 - Particulate matter with diameter smaller than 10 µm (PM10) close to surface (10 meter above ground (μg/m³)
* pm2_5 - Particulate matter with diameter smaller than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) close to surface (10 meter above ground) (μg/m³)
* carbon_monoxide - Atmospheric gases close to surface (10 meter above ground) (μg/m³)
* carbon_dioxide - CO2 close to surface (10 meter above ground) (ppm)
* nitrogen_dioxide - Atmospheric gases close to surface (10 meter above ground) (μg/m³)
* sulphur_dioxide - Atmospheric gases close to surface (10 meter above ground) (μg/m³)
* ozone - Atmospheric gases close to surface (10 meter above ground) (μg/m³)
* alder_pollen - Pollen for alder (Grains/m³)
* birch_pollen - Pollen for birch (Grains/m³)
* grass_pollen - Pollen for grass (Grains/m³)
* mugwort_pollen - Pollen for mugwort (Grains/m³)
* olive_pollen - Pollen for olive (Grains/m³)
* ragweed_pollen - Pollen for ragweed (Grains/m³)
* european_aqi - European Air Quality Index (AQI) calculated for different particulate matter and gases individually. The consolidated european_aqi returns the maximum of all individual indices. Ranges from 0-20 (good), 20-40 (fair), 40-60 (moderate), 60-80 (poor), 80-100 (very poor) and exceeds 100 for extremely poor conditions.
* formaldehyde - It is a volatile organic compound (VOC) that can be released from various sources, including building materials, household products, furniture, and tobacco smoke (ppm)
* pm10_wildfires - Particulate matter with diameter smaller than 10 µm (PM10) caused by wildfires (μg/m³)
* nitrogen_monoxide - Atmospheric gases close to surface (10 meter above ground) (μg/m³)
